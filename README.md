# Chord Diagram Visualization
This tutorial is an expansion on how to create legends on the complex chord diagram, the manual of circlize package on R can be found [here](https://jokergoo.github.io/circlize_book/book/the-chorddiagram-function.html). Again, this tutorial will be very similar to what chapter 13-15 cover in the manual, but it doesn't have a thorough detail on how to create legends of the diagram shown below, as I found very frustrated. I also notice people are going through the same stuggle as much as I do, mostly just don't know how to add the color to the color grid and add the corresponding number into the grid, so I thought I'd share the script.
